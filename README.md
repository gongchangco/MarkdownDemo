## What is Markdown ? ðŸ¤”
Markdown is used extensively for formatting content on the GitHub platform.
It is a lightweight markup language designed to simplify the process of formatting text, making it easy to read and write in its raw form while still being convertable to HTML or other rich text formats. This syntax allows writers to focus more on content and less on its presentation, making it particularly popular in web development, content writing, and technical documentation.

`SIMPLY: IT'S JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF TEXT FILE, LIKE .txt .doc ....( now it's .md) AND IT HAS SOME SPECIAL SYNTAX.`

*There is no clearly defined Markdown standard. This has led to fragmentation as different vendors write their own variants of the language to correct flaws or add missing features...*

This demonstration will mainly focus on GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

## Why use markdown ? 
Because it's:
* **EASY** : The syntax is so easy that you can learn in a minute or two then write without noticing anything weird or geeky.
* **FAST** : It saves time compared to other types of text files/formats. It helps boost the productivity and workflows of writer.
* **CLEAN** : Both the syntax and output are clean, not messy with our eyes and simple to manage.
* **FLEXIBLE** : With just a little set-up, your text will be translated cross any platform out there, editable in any text-editing software and convertible to a wide array of formats.

**In short**, normal users will find it useful in any cases, especially when you are in need of something better than plain text but less functional than Microsoft Word.

**For Developers**, if you are lazy to write HTML code , you will love markdown. **Moreover**, **Github** and many sites favor markdown for readme file of projects. That means you gonna meet markdown in your life one way or another.

## Markdown Syntax
All Syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) . It would take a lot of effort to describe syntax in text (they will be formatted) so please consider this table below for the whole basics syntax.
