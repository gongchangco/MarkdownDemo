## What is Markdown ?
Markdown is used extensively for formatting content on the GitHub platform.
It is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML. Markdown is often used to format README files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

`SIMPLY: IT'S JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF TEXT FILE, LIKE .txt .doc ....( now it's .md) AND IT HAS SOME SPECIAL SYNTAX.`
